# Perimeter-complexity-for-script
Perimeter complexity is a measure of the complexity of a shape's perimeter, which represents the boundary of the shape. The more complex the perimeter, the more irregular the shape is considered to be.

The Pelli algorithm is a method for calculating the perimeter complexity of a shape, which involves measuring the number of pixels that make up the shape's perimeter and dividing it by the square root of the shape's area. This provides a normalized measure of the perimeter complexity that accounts for the size of the shape.

The formula for calculating perimeter complexity using the Pelli algorithm is:

perimeter complexity = (perimeter length^2) / (4 * pi * area)

where perimeter length is the length of the shape's perimeter, and area is the area of the shape. This formula is a variation of the Pelli algorithm that provides a similar normalized measure of perimeter complexity by taking into account the shape's size.
